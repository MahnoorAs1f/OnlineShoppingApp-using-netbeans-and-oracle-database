üõçÔ∏è Project Description: FINAL MAHNOOR‚ÄôS STORE
FINAL MAHNOOR‚ÄôS STORE is a Java-based desktop application that simulates an interactive online shopping platform. It is developed as an educational project to demonstrate how an e-commerce system can be designed and implemented using graphical user interfaces and object-oriented programming principles.

The application provides a user-friendly environment where two types of users ‚Äî Administrators and Customers ‚Äî can perform specific tasks according to their roles. The platform enables customers to browse products, add items to their cart, and place orders, while administrators can manage product listings and categories through a dedicated admin dashboard.

üîß Technologies Used
Java SE (Standard Edition): Core programming language used to build the application logic and GUI components.

Java Swing: A built-in GUI toolkit in Java used to create forms, panels, buttons, tables, and other user interface elements.

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Used for establishing a connection between the application and the backend database to store user credentials, product details, and orders.

NetBeans IDE: Integrated Development Environment used for writing, compiling, and managing the project with structured GUI form design.

AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit): Used alongside Swing for handling lower-level events and layout management.

Image Handling (JPG/PNG): Product images are integrated into the GUI to provide a visually rich user experience.

üßë‚Äçüíº Administrator Functionality
Administrators are granted full control over the store's contents. After logging in securely through the admin interface, they are directed to a central dashboard that allows them to manage categories and product inventory efficiently. The system supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on product and category data.

Admin capabilities include:

Adding new product categories.

Creating product entries with names, prices, and images.

Editing or deleting existing products.

Organizing products under appropriate categories.

Navigating across different management sections using a dashboard interface.

This module ensures that the admin can keep the store updated and well-maintained with minimal effort.

üë§ Customer Functionality
Customers can access the application by registering with their personal information. After successful registration and login, they are presented with a welcoming and interactive interface where they can view all available categories and products.

Customer features include:

Creating a new user account via registration form.

Securely logging into the system.

Browsing through different product categories.

Viewing detailed product descriptions with images and prices.

Adding multiple items to a shopping cart.

Reviewing the cart before purchase.

Placing an order through a simple checkout form.

The interface is designed to be intuitive, clean, and visually appealing, mimicking the core experience of popular online shopping platforms.

üõí Shopping Workflow
The shopping experience is straightforward and streamlined. Once a customer logs in, they can explore product categories and view relevant items. Each product is displayed with its name, price, and a representative image. Products can be added to a cart with a single click. The cart shows a list of selected items along with quantities and prices. When ready, the customer proceeds to place an order using the order form, which includes confirmation messages upon success.

The system is event-driven and reacts to user actions in real-time, ensuring a responsive and smooth user experience.
